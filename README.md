# ServletUserPreferencesApp
Create
a Java web application that uses servlets to capture three user preferences
(e.g., preferred language, theme, and notification setting), store them in an
HTTP session, and then display them in subsequent requests. The application
should manage sessions, allowing users to persist their preferences across
multiple interactions until the session expires or the user logs out. The
servlet should accept three user preferences:
preferredLanguage (e.g., English, Spanish, French)

theme (e.g.,
Dark Mode, Light Mode)

notificationSetting (e.g.,
Email, SMS, None)
